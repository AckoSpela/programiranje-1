----- QUICK GLANCE AT THE FIELD MODULE -----
Open up field.ml and field.mli and check how much of the module code is hidden
by the .mli file.

Why is the type symbol explicitly written in the .mli and why do we want to
keep the definition of the type field hidden?

Use the field.mli file as a guide on how to use the Field module for the next
part.

----- FIXING THE GAME -----
In the file game.ml some function definitions are not complete.
Luckily all the nasty details of working with symbols and fields are hidden
in the Field module.

Things to fix in game.ml:

1.) Write the definition of switch_symbol.
2.) In make_move correct the following:
      - Print out the player whose turn it is.
      - After receiving input, set the symbol in the field to correct value.
      - Write how to handle possible errors.
3.) In game_loop:
      - Check if the game was won.
      - Check if the game is a draw.
      - Uncomment the rest of the code that continues the loop.
